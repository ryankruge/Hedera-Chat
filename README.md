[Hedera Chat]

[Description]
This is a simple TCP chat server that utilises the built-in 'WS' API offered by Windows. This was a personal project of mine that I took an interest in recently as I have dabbled with networking in the past.

[Bugs]
I understand that this program has bugs and I will potentially release an updated version to address these issues, however, there are no guarantees.
